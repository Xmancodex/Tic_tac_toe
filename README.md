# Tic_tac_toe - User vs User Interface Game
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe User Interface Game! This classic game allows two players to compete head-to-head in a turn-based match. Instead of clicking or tapping spots on the board, players select positions by inputting specific numbers corresponding to the quadrants of the grid.

# Features
User vs User Gameplay: Play against a friend in a competitive and fun interface.

Number Input for Moves: Players choose their spots by inputting numbers between 1-9, each representing a specific cell in the 3x3 grid.

Clear Quadrant Mapping: Each cell in the Tic Tac Toe grid corresponds to a specific number, making gameplay intuitive:
1	2	3
4	5	6
7	8	9
Win, Lose, or Draw Detection: The game automatically detects winning combinations or a draw and announces the result.

# How to Play
Player 1 (X) starts by selecting a number (1-9) to mark their spot.
Player 2 (O) follows, choosing an available number to place their mark.
Turns alternate until one player wins by forming a line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) or the game ends in a draw.
Input is validated to ensure players can only select available spots.
